 * _23_Effects
 *
 * This synth demonstrates how to set up, use, and access multiple effects 
 * for a Voice.
 *
 * In this synth, the voice's oscillator output will be run through 2 
 * effects: an autowah and a bit-shift filter (used here for distortion).
 *

 *             ##############################################
 *
 * The Voice class has a chain of controls, effects, which are used to 
 * process the oscillator output. The Voice class also has a method, 
 * addEffect(), for adding a control to the chain of effects.
 * 
 *    class Voice  ...
 *    {
 *       Effects  effects;                // chain of effects
 * 
 *       void     addEffect( Effect* );   // add an effect  
 *
 *       ... lots of other stuff ...
 *
 *    } ;
 *
 *                      How Amplitude Modulation Works
 *
 * As with the controls in pitchMods (see prior tutorial), each control in
 * ampMods is a Factor, meaning that it has an output value -- a public 
 * variable of type double named "value".
 *
 * At each dynamic update the system will iterate through all the controls
 * in the ampMods chain (skipping those that are muted), and multiply all
 * their output values together, and then apply this result to the current
 * volume of the oscillator, yielding an "instantaneous output level".
 *
 *   --------------------------------------------------------------------

 *             ##############################################
 *             #######       Accessing effects        #######
 *             ##############################################
 *
 * There are four ways to access the chain of effects:
 *
 *   1) From the Console, when you are at the voice prompt, type 'E'.
 *      This pushes the effects object to the top of the mode stack.
 *      You will now be "in" the effects object, with a "Effects" prompt 
 *      showing on the Console.
 *
 *      [Note: How you get to the voice prompt in the first place
 *             depends on how the synth was constructed. If your
 *             synth is derived from the VoxSynth class (or a
 *             class that inherits from it) then typing a number
 *             (0-based) at the synth> prompt will push that voice
 *             to the top of mode stack. For example, typing '0'
 *             at the synth> prompt will push the 1st voice.]
 *
 *   2) From the code, execute the equivalent macro. For example, if
 *      your synth derives from a VoxSynth, and you are currently at
 *      the "synth>" prompt (i.e., the synth is the top mode on the
 *      mode stack), then the following macro will push the effects 
 *      object of voice 0 to the top of the mode stack:
 *
 *                   console.exe( PSTR("0E") );
 *
 *   3) From the ArduTouch keyboard, if the voice is the current mode 
 *      (i.e. the top mode on the mode stack), then:
 *
 *          > double-tap the right button to bring up the voice's menu
 *          > press the C key to push the effects object
 *
 *      [Note: How you get to the voice mode in the first place
 *             depends on how the synth was constructed. If your
 *             synth is derived from the VoxSynth class then double-
 *             tapping the right button will bring up the synth's menu.
 *             At this point, if your synth is derived from OneVoxSynth,
 *             simply press the C# key. If it is a multi-voice synth
 *             then pressing the C# key brings up a number menu, and
 *             you select the voice you want by number (pressing C 
 *             pushes voice 0, pressing C# pushes voice 1, etc.) ]
 *
 *      Please note that keyboard menus are not available if your sketch
 *      is compiled using the __BAREBONE__ runtime model.
 *
 *   4) From the code, explicitly push the effects object onto the 
 *      mode stack. For example, from within a Voice method:
 *
 *                    pushMode( &this->effects );
 *      
 *             ##############################################
 *             #######  Accessing a specific control  #######
 *             ##############################################
 *
 *   Once you are in effects (i.e., the Effects prompt is displayed in the
 *   Console, which means that effects is the current -- top -- mode) you
 *   can access a specific control in the chain by:
 *
 *   1) From the Console, when at the 'Effects' prompt, type the shortcut for 
 *      the control (usually the 1st letter of its name). For example, in 
 *      this synth, type 'a' to push the autowah control, type 'b' to push 
 *      the bit-shift filter control.
 *
 *   2) From the Console, when at the 'Effects' prompt, type the number (0-based)
 *      for the control which corresponds to its order in the chain. For 
 *      example, in this synth, type '0' to push the bit-shift filter, type '1'
 *      to push the autowah control. This is the general way to get to any
 *      control. You might have 2 controls with the same shortcut, or perhaps
 *      you are using multiple instances of the same control. In this case 
 *      typing the shortcut for the control would push the 1st instance of that
 *      control in the chain. To get to the 2nd and 3rd instance of the control 
 *      you would need to access them by number. Note that the Console displays 
 *      the controls in the order they were added to the chain.
 *
 *   3) From the ArduTouch keyboard, when effects is the current mode, double-
 *      tap the right button to bring up the effects menu. Now the keys 
 *      correspond to numbers, C = 0, C# = 1, D = 2, etc ... Press the key
 *      that corresponds to the ordinal of the control. For example, in this
 *      synth press C (0) to push the bit-shift filter, or press C# (1) to push 
 *      the autowah.
 *
 *   4) As always anything that can be done by typing at the console can
 *      be incorporated into a macro and executed in the code. For example,
 *      in this synth, executing the following macro while in the Voice mode 
 *      would push the autowah control:
 *
 *                   console.exe( PSTR("Ea") );
 *
 *   5) From the code, the control can be addressed directly, as long as you
 *      declare it, or a pointer to it, as a member of your voice. For example,
 *      in this synth:
 *
 *                    autowah.setDepth( .90 );
