 * _21_Pitch_Modifiers
 *
 * This example synth demonstrates how to use multiple pitch modifiers on
 * a Voice to create complex pitch effects.
 *
 * It also introduces control chains.
 *
 * In this synth, each time a note is played it will quickly "ramp" up
 * an octave and back down to the original pitch while a vibrato is also 
 * active. 
 *

 *             #######        Control Chains          #######
 *             ##############################################
 *
 * The Voice class contains 3 built-in control "chains", and 3 corresponding
 * methods by which a control can be added to its respective chain:
 * 
 *    class Voice  ...
 *    {
 *       ... lots of other stuff ...
 *      
 *       AmpMods     ampMods;             // chain of amplitude modifiers
 *       PitchMods   pitchMods;           // chain of pitch modifiers
 *       Effects     effects;             // chain of effects
 * 
 *       ... lots of other stuff ...
 *
 *       void  addAmpMod( Factor* );      // add an amplitude modifier  
 *       void  addPitchMod( Factor* );    // add a pitch modifier  
 *       void  addEffect( Effect* );      // add an effect 
 *
 *       ... lots of other stuff ...
 *
 *    } ;
 *
 * In this example we are only interested in the pitchMods chain.
 * The other chains will be explained in latter examples.
 *
 *             ##############################################
 *             #######   PitchMods technical details   ######
 *             ##############################################
 *
 * The PitchMods class is derived from the ControlChain class, which 
 * is in turn derived from the Mode class:
 *
 *    class ControlChain : public Mode    // a chain of controls of type TControl
 *    {
 *       ... lots of other stuff ...
 *      
 *       TControl* chain;                 // pts to 1st control in chain
 *    } ;
 *
 *
 * Notice that the ControlChain class contains a ptr to the first control
 * in the chain. This will be NULL if there are no controls in the chain.
 *
 * TControl is a generic base class for dynamic controls that can be chained 
 * together, and contains a ptr, named 'next', to the next control in the chain 
 * (or NULL if there is no next control):
 *
 *    class TControl : public DynaControl  // a chainable, dynamic control 
 *    {
 *       ... lots of other stuff ...
 *      
 *       TControl *next;                   // ptr to next control in chain
 *
 *    } ;
 *
 * Given this line of code: 
 *
 *    Voice *x = new Voice();
 *
 * then:
 *
 *   ( x->pitchMods.chain == NULL ) is true
 *
 * because there are initially no effects in the pitchMods chain.
 *
 * To add a control to the chain we use Voice::addPitchMod( Factor * )
 *
 * Notice that the argument to addPitchMod() is a pointer to a "Factor".
 *
 * A Factor is a TControl which contains the variable "value" :
 *
 *    class Factor : public TControl 
 *    {
 *        double  value;                   // current output value 
 *    } ;
 *
 *     --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * In summary, the pitchMods object in the Voice class contains a ptr to the 
 * 1st control (if any) in the chain of pitch modulators. Each control in the 
 * pitchMods chain is derived from the Factor base class, which means 
 * that each control in the chain: 
 *
 *    1) has a ptr "next" to the next control (if any) in the chain
 *    2) has a double "value" which contains its current output value
 *
 * The Voice method addPitchMod( Factor * ) is used to add a control to the
 * chain of pitch modulators.
 *
 *                        How Pitch Modulation Works
 *
 * At each dynamic update the system will iterate through all the controls
 * in the pitchMods chain (skipping those that are muted), and multiply all
 * their output values together, and then apply this result to the current
 * frequency of the oscillator, yielding an "instantaneous frequency".
 *
 *   --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *             ##############################################
 *             #######     Accessing pitchMods        #######
 *             ##############################################
 *
 * There are three ways to access the chain of pitch modulators:
 *
 *   1) From the Console, when you are at the voice prompt, type 'P'
 *      You will now be "in" the pitchMods object, with a "Pitch>"
 *      prompt showing on the Console.
 *
 *      [Note: How you get to the voice prompt in the first place
 *             depends on how the synth was constructed. If your
 *             synth is derived from the VoxSynth class (or a
 *             class that inherits from it) then typing a number
 *             (0-based) at the synth> prompt will push that voice
 *             to the top of mode stack. For example, typing '0'
 *             at the synth> prompt will push the 1st voice.]
 *
 *   2) From the code, execute the equivalent macro. For example, if
 *      your synth derives from a VoxSynth, and you are currently at
 *      the "synth>" prompt (i.e., the synth is the top mode on the
 *      mode stack), then the following macro will push the pitchMods 
 *      object of voice 0 to the top of the mode stack:
 *
 *                   console.exe( PSTR("0P") );
 *
 *   3) From the ArduTouch keyboard, if the voice is the current mode 
 *      (i.e. the top mode on the mode stack), then:
 *
 *          > double-tap the right button to bring up the voice's menu
 *          > press the D# key to push the pitchMods object
 *
 *      [Note: How you get to the voice mode in the first place
 *             depends on how the synth was constructed. If your
 *             synth is derived from the VoxSynth class then double-
 *             tapping the right button will bring up the synth's menu.
 *             At this point, if your synth is derived from OneVoxSynth,
 *             simply press the C# key. If it is a multi-voice synth
 *             then pressing the C# key brings up a number menu, and
 *             you select the voice you want to push by number (pressing C 
 *             pushes voice 0, pressing C# pushes voice 1, etc.) ]
 *
 *      Please note that keyboard menus are not available if your sketch
 *      is compiled using the __BAREBONE__ runtime model.
 *
 *   4) From the code, explicitly push the pitchMods object onto the 
 *      mode stack. For example, from within a Voice method:
 *
 *                    pushMode( &this->pitchMods );
 *

 *
 * This simple "Ramp" control will oscillate in value from 1.0 to 2.0.
 *
 * We derive it from the library's TermLFO class ("Terminating LFO").

 * configured to traverse a specific number of half cycles after being
 * triggered and then stop oscillating.
 *
 * (In the "reset" code for our synth further down in this file, we will 
 * initialize our Ramp control so that it traverses 2 half cycles. 
 * This means that it will start at 1.0, move to 2.0, return to 1.0, and 
 * then stop oscillating, each time a note is played).
