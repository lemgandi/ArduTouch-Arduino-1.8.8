/*
    Commands.h  

    Defines for all ASCII codes which are conventionally used as "commands"
    for objects derived from the Mode class, and which are sent to them via 
    their charEv() method.

    Command codes are by convention negative to avoid clashing with the codes
    of alphanumeric characters.
